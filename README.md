```yaml
- name: Deploy to staging
  uses: jahvon/flow-action@v1
  with:
    executable: 'deploy staging'
    workspaces: |
      backend: ./backend

          secrets: |
            {"shared-secret": "${{ secrets.SHARED_SECRET }}"}

  deploy:
    needs: setup
    steps:
      - uses: jahvon/flow-action@v1
        with:
          executable: 'deploy production'
          vault-key: ${{ needs.setup.outputs.vault-key }}
          secrets: |
            {"deploy-key": "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}"}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
- name: Complex deployment
  uses: jahvon/flow-action@v1
